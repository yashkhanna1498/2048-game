# 2048-game
I developed this project while studying at Coding Ninjas for Python DS course.

1) You must have Tkinter binding installed in order to play the game.
2) Execute the 'run.py' in order to play the game :relaxed:
3) Use the keys W,A,S,D for moving the blocks.
4) Aim is to create 2048 block.
5) I have achieved the highest block of 16384 :sunglasses: :sunglasses:
